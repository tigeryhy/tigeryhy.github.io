## About

Welcome to the Third DialDoc Workshop co-located with [ACL 2023](https://2023.aclweb.org).

DialDoc workshop focuses on Document-Grounded Dialogue and Conversational Question Answering.
Given the vast amount of content created every day in various mediums, it is a meaningful yet challenging task not only
to make such content _accessible_ to end users via various conversational interfaces but also to make sure the responses
provided by the models are _grounded_ and _faithful_ with respect to the knowledge sources. The purpose of this workshop
is to invite researchers and practitioners to bring their individual perspectives on the subject of grounded dialogue
and conversational question answering to advance the field in a joint effort. We also host a shared task on grounded
dialogue based on multilingual documents, which aims to extend the current advances to languages other than English.

Topics of interests include but not limited to

- Document-grounded dialogue and conversational machine reading;
- Knowledge-grounded dialogue generation with pre-trained language models;
- Open domain dialogue and conversational QA;
- Topical open-domain conversational chat;
- Parsing semi-structured document content for dialogue and conversational QA, table reading;
- Evaluation for document-grounded dialogue;
- Interpretability and faithfulness in dialogue modeling;
- Dialogue summarization and query-based summarization.

## Calls

We welcome submissions of original work as long or short papers, as well as non-archival papers. We also accept paper
submissions via ARR. All accepted papers will be presented at the workshop.

We will have the Best Paper Award and Best Student Paper Award, which will be announced during the workshop.

### Submission Instructions

Formatting Guidelines:
We accept long (eight pages plus unlimited references) and short (four pages plus unlimited references) papers, which
should conform to ARR CFP guidelines.

## Shared Task

### Task1 Mixed-lingual DGDS

We will provide annotated data in English, Chinese, French, and Vietnamese for training; and then evaluate models in all
four languages.

Training: document set contains 4 languages and we have sample conversations grounded on documents of 4 languages.
Testing: testing conversations in 4 languages which contain evidences in documents of 4 languages

### Task2 Cross-lingual DGDS

We will provide sizable annotated data in a source language (e.g. English) and limited data in the target language for
training; then evaluate the models in the target language for the settings such as English-to-Chinese and
Chinese-to-Vietnamese.

Training: document set and conversation set with grounding labels in English and/or Chinese.
Testing: testing conversations in French and/or Vietnamese which contain evidences in documents of 2 source languages (
English, Chinese)

### Important Dates

The challenge includes leaderboards for two task settings with two phases, Dev (TestDev) and Test phase,

- Datasets ready & Baseline Models : February 6, 2023
- Dev Phase Start : February 13, 2023
- Test Phase Start : March 25, 2023
- Date of Leaderboard submissionï¼šMarch 31, 2023
